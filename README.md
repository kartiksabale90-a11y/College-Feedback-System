The College Feedback System is a web-based application designed to collect anonymous feedback from students about classroom lectures.
It allows students to submit feedback silently without fear or hesitation, helping teachers improve teaching quality.

This project is developed as part of the Software Engineering course (FY BCS – NEP 2023) and follows basic SDLC principles.
